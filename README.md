# Trophic
Trophic is a C++ graphics library and OpenGL wrapper, designed with 2D graphics and particle rendering in mind.

## Features:
- Uses templates to automatically generate code for any vertex format
- RAII for all objects guarantees resources are freed when no longer required
- Includes shaders to draw huge numbers of sprites efficiently
- Proof of concept but usable.
